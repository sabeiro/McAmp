#ifndef _pin_magic_
#define _pin_magic_
// This header file serves two purposes:
//
// 1) Isolate non-portable MCU port- and pin-specific identifiers and
// operations so the library code itself remains somewhat agnostic
// (PORTs and pin numbers are always referenced through macros).
//
// 2) GCC doesn't always respect the "inline" keyword, so this is a
// ham-fisted manner of forcing the issue to minimize function calls.
// This sometimes makes the library a bit bigger than before, but fast++.
// However, because they're macros, we need to be SUPER CAREFUL about
// parameters -- for example, write8(x) may expand to multiple PORT
// writes that all refer to x, so it needs to be a constant or fixed
// variable and not something like *ptr++ (which, after macro
// expansion, may increment the pointer repeatedly and run off into
// la-la land). Macros also give us fine-grained control over which
// operations are inlined on which boards (balancing speed against
// available program space).
// When using the TFT shield, control and data pins exist in set physical
// locations, but the ports and bitmasks corresponding to each vary among
// boards. A separate set of pin definitions is given for each supported
// board type.
// When using the TFT breakout board, control pins are configurable but
// the data pins are still fixed -- making every data pin configurable
// would be much too slow. The data pin layouts are not the same between
// the shield and breakout configurations -- for the latter, pins were
// chosen to keep the tutorial wiring manageable more than making optimal
// use of ports and bitmasks. So there's a second set of pin definitions
// given for each supported board.
// Shield pin usage:

// Breakout pin usage:
// LCD Data Bit : 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 0
// Uno dig. pin : 7 6 5 4 3 2 9 8
// Uno port/pin : PD7 PD6 PD5 PD4 PD3 PD2 PB1 PB0
// Mega dig. pin: 27 6 5 4 3 2 9 8
// Mega port/pin: PH4 PH3 PE3 PG5 PE5 PE4 PH6 PH5

// Pixel read operations require a minimum 400 nS delay from RD_ACTIVE
// to polling the input pins. At 16 MHz, one machine cycle is 62.5 nS.
// This code burns 7 cycles (437.5 nS) doing nothing; the RJMPs are
// equivalent to two NOPs each, final NOP burns the 7th cycle, and the
// last line is a radioactive mutant emoticon.

// As part of the inline control, macros reference other macros...if any
// of these are left undefined, an equivalent function version (non-inline)
// is declared later. The Uno has a moderate amount of program space, so
// only write8() is inlined -- that one provides the most performance
// benefit, but unfortunately also generates the most bloat. This is
// why only certain cases are inlined for each board.
